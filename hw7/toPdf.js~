/*
* These insert statements lay out the schema for my database. I did not edit the schema very much to suit this data, as 
* it did not prove necessary to do so. Things I did change include: changing active and available from either a Y or N 
* to a boolean value (true/false), separating the author's name in book to first and last name, and adding multiple 
* addresses for each publisher, multiple subjects for each book and multiple notes for each book to accommodate the 
* data given.
